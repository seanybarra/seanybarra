<!-- About Me section -->
### Hello, how's it going? :man_technologist:

I'm Sean, a software developer based in Los Angeles.

More specifically I've been working as a Frontend Engineer since 2021.

Currently teaching myself React, I've been really motivated this year to start creating more. My long term goal is to be a Full Stack Developer, but above all else I really want to be somebody that inspires others to keep learning, creating, and being curious.

Outside of work, I read a lot if I'm not looking at a computer screen I'm looking at my Kindle. I also brew mead and beer, I've always liked the brewery/bar scene because it brings people together from all walks of life. I am also working on getting another degree in Electrical Engineering or some other science related field, I just like learning and school scratches my achievement hunter tendecies.

I hope to have a portfolio site done sometime this year hopefully.

If you would like to connect add me on here I would be completely down to collaborating if any open projects were to arise.
